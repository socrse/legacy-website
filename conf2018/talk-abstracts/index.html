  <strong>Invited keynote: Nammu and Oracc: digital humanities software in the sustainable development of Iraqi history and heritage</strong><br><em>Eleanor Robson</em><br><em>(University College London)</em>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;float: none"></div>
</summary><blockquote>
<p>The past few years of conflict in Syria and Iraq have drawn worldwide attention to the terrorist destruction of archaeological sites and historic buildings in the region. Large international projects are now working to protect, conserve and document these places that are so fundamental to understanding Middle Eastern and global history. But that is a solution to only one part of the problem, however important it is in itself. The GCRF-funded Nahrein Network tackles the human side of this tragedy, helping local heritage experts, academic historians and history-lovers contribute meaningfully to the long-term social and economic development of post-conflict Iraq and its neighbours. Open-access, reusable online resources are a natural solution to increasing the accessibility of academic research, teaching materials, and reliable information for interested publics, in a region where everyone has a phone but libraries are scarce and massively under-resourced. As part of this effort UCL’s Research Software Development Group is adapting open-access tools for Arabophone ancient historians to work with. Nammu is an easy-to-use text-editor for cuneiform inscriptions, the millions of witnesses to the first three millennia of Middle Eastern and world history. Oracc is a collaborative online publishing platform for these editions, and for educational websites about ancient Middle Eastern history. In this talk I will explain how Nammu and Oracc are key components of a programme designed to reduce Middle Eastern academics’ international isolation, train the next generation of experts in ancient Middle Eastern history, cultural heritage, and related fields, and to help local audiences make meaning of local heritage, in local languages and local contexts. I’ll also talk through the how the project is working in practice, from the involvement of the RSEs in London in the initial research design through to the implementation with researchers, teachers and students in Baghdad and beyond.</p>
<p>Eleanor Robson is Professor of Ancient Middle Eastern History and Head of the History Department at University College London. She has three main research interests: the social and political contexts of knowledge production in the cuneiform culture of ancient Iraq, five to two thousand years ago; the construction of knowledge about ancient Iraq in Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East over the past two centuries; and use of open, standards-based online resources for democratising access to knowledge about the ancient Middle East. These three fields come together in the Nahrein Network, funded by the Uk Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Global Challenges Research fund, 2017-20. Working with multiple academic and non-academic partners, it aims to significantly develop the capacity of Middle Eastern universities, museums, archives and cultural heritage sites to foster cultural and economic growth in the region.</p>

  <strong>Challenges and pathways to sustainability in scientific software ecosystems</strong><br><em>James Howison</em><br><em>(University of Texas at Austin)</em>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;float: none"></div>
</summary><blockquote>
<p>A key challenge of science policy is to achieve sustained benefit from scientific grant making. As software has become more important to the practice of science, policy makers and scientists have become more concerned about a perceived lack of sustained benefit from software produced by grant funded projects. In this presentation I will provide a framework for thinking about sustainability in scientific software projects, based on empirical studies of development and use of software in science. The framework starts by asking: what is it that causes sustainability problems anyway? Over time, software declines in scientific usefulness, driven by five factors: a moving scientific frontier, technological change, friction in building software, friction in using software and, least appreciated, change in the software ecosystem sounding a component. These factors drive a need for work; in response we can try to suppress the drivers, try to reduce the amount of work needed, or attract sufficient resources able to undertake the work needed to sustain scientific usefulness. I will analyze three systems by which projects obtain resources: commercial markets, grant-making, and community based peer-production. I will conclude with recent results from a study into pathways to sustainable peer production.</p>
<p>James Howison is an Associate Professor in the Information School of the University of Texas at Austin. His research examines technology and human collaboration, especially the organization of work. He has studied the organization of open source software development and is currently studying the organization of scientific software development. His work has been funded by the National Science Foundation, including an NSF CAREER award to study transitions from grant funding, and the Sloan Foundation to improve the citation of scientific software. Originally from Australia, he was a post-doc at Carnegie Mellon Computer Science and received his Ph.D. in 2009 at the School of Information studies at Syracuse University.</p>

  <strong>Building computer vision systems that really work</strong><br><em>Andrew Fitzgibbon</em><br><em></em>
</div>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/rse.ac.uk/conf2018/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/panel_microsoft-300x150-300x150.png?resize=120%2C60&ssl=1"></p>
<div style="clear: both;float: none"></div>
</summary><blockquote>
<p>Andrew Fitzgibbon has been shipping advanced computer vision systems for twenty years. In 1999, prize-winning research from Oxford University was spun out to become the Emmy-award-winning camera tracker “boujou”, which has been used to insert computer graphics into live-action footage in pretty much every movie made since its release, from the “Harry Potter” series to “Bridget Jones’s Diary”. In 2007, he was part of the team that delivered human body tracking in Kinect for Xbox 360, and in 2015 he moved from Microsoft Research to the Windows division to work on Microsoft’s HoloLens, an AR headset brimming with cutting-edge computer vision technology. In all of these projects, the academic state of the art has had to be leapfrogged in accuracy and efficiency, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. Sometimes that’s just raw engineering, sometimes it means completely new ways of looking at the research. If he had to nominate one key to success, it’s fanatical test-driven development (TDD), but what really gets it done is a focus on, well, everything: from cache misses to end-to-end experience, and on always being willing to change one’s mind.</p>
<p>Biography: Fitzgibbon is a partner scientist at Microsoft in Cambridge, UK. He has published numerous highly-cited papers, and received many awards for his work, including ten “best paper” prizes at various venues, the Silver medal of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and the BCS Roger Needham award. He is a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, the British Computer Society, and the International Association for Pattern Recognition. He studied at University College, Cork, and then did a Masters at Heriot-Watt University, before taking up an RSE job at the University of Edinburgh, which eventually morphed into a PhD. He moved to Oxford in 1996 and drove large software projects such as the VXL project, and then spent several years as a Royal Society University Research Fellow before joining Microsoft in 2005. He loves programming, particularly in C++, and his recent work has included new numerical algorithms for Eigen, and compilation of F# to a non-garbage-collected runtime.</p>

Rather than ask researchers for a data management plan, we now ask them to provide a broader outputs management plan which describes how they will manage and share all significant outputs (data, software or materials) resulting from their research.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will discuss the activities Wellcome is developing to support the implementation of this policy and promote open research more broadly – with a particular focus on research software. I will describe where we are focusing as a funder and some of the remaining opportunities and challenges we are seeking to address, and then invite discussion and feedback on how research funders can best support the RSE community in maximising the value of research software.</p>
<p>David Carr is part of the Open Research team at Wellcome, which is progressing work to maximise the availability and use of research outputs (including data, publications, code and materials), in ways that will enhance the research enterprise and accelerate health benefits. Prior to this, David worked as a Policy Adviser where he led on work to develop and communicate Wellcome’s policy in several areas, including data sharing, open access publishing, biosecurity and genetics. In 2001, he worked on secondment at the World Health Organisation in Geneva, where he assisted in the preparation of the Advisory Committee on Health Research (ACHR) report on Genomics and World Health. Prior to joining Wellcome in 1999, David worked as a project researcher at a scientific consultancy firm in Cambridge. He has undergraduate and masters degrees in genetics from the University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>The world’s largest fusion experiment, the Joint European Torus (JET), has used data systems to store and expose its data to researchers continuously for over 30 years.</p>
<p>There are particular software challenges in providing data access for such a long-running international experiment with many competing goals in play: accommodating evolving data production, consistency for software used in experimental operations, ease of use for a transient population of visiting researchers, robust remote access and tackling the increase in complexity and maintenance load over time. We must also plan ahead to ensure JET data remains useful for future generations.</p>
<p>The UKAEA Software Engineering Group has been working to modernise access to JET data and enable use of object storage solutions. The new access system, Simple Access Layer (SAL), was launched recently and will gradually pull all JET data into a single tree structure with a simple access API. It uses modern Python and web technologies and could be adapted for structured data in other domains.</p>
<p>In this talk the architect of SAL will present the design decisions and trade-offs involved in engineering a system that is simple to use, cheap to maintain and agnostic to storage solution.</p>

Then we set about trying to achieve these goals. In this talk I will briefly illustrate several of the key lessons we’ve learned, for example the importance of version control and convincing people to use it, or how we are trying to support RSEs across the University. I’ll explain why we try not to do coding for people (isn’t that what an RSE is supposed to do?) and some of the most frequent advice people ask from us. I might even tell you why optimising your code may be the wrong thing to do.</p>

<p>Interactive languages such as Python are very popular choices when it comes to data processing. The fact that these languages are interactive, simple, but feature-rich makes them ideal tools for quick data visualization and analysis. In contrast, compiled languages such as C++ tend to be avoided because they offer more limited interactivity and are more complex to master, which reduces productivity. Yet they deliver the best possible performances, their stricter rules makes them more maintainable in the long run, and being non-interactive they also maximize reproducibility. In this talk I will show how, without compromising on performance and correctness, modern C++ and libraries enable a productivity and simplicity approaching that of interactive languages. The latter can then be used exclusively for what they do best: data visualization. I propose that adopting such framework for daily coding in research can improve robustness, productivity, and replicability, and should be encouraged in teaching.</p>

A flat HR structure supports a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) based on an Agile methodology, routing work through a project manager, analysts, UI/UX designers, software engineers, and a systems manager. Entry-level, Senior, and Principal roles are defined in a lab career development document, aligned to Agile DSDM® and Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA). The lab HR policy encourages staff to produce career portfolios, including a wide variety of outputs from code to design artefacts, for assessment by a promotions panel. Conversations are under way with IT and HR to scale the lab approach to RSE careers towards the wider university, grafting it onto the emerging IT People Strategy as a defined career path that can support recruitment and retention.

At the end of the talk, you will have received a high-level overview of AI technologies and their use in research, have seen some cool examples of how AI has been used in a wide range of research areas, and have a good sense of where to go to learn more.</p>

  <strong>Surviving as an Apprentice Developer</strong><br><em>Matthew Richards</em><br><em>(STFC)</em>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;float: none"></div>
</summary><blockquote>
<p>In this industry, software engineers have a vast array of knowledge with in-depth systems and often specialist knowledge (especially in the area of research). I’ve been a degree software engineering apprentice at STFC, fresh from A-Levels for just under a year and discovered how daunting the industry can be for those with little experience. It can be difficult when colleagues assume you know what they’re talking about all day but in reality, you’ve understood roughly ten words they’ve said in as many minutes. This talk will be about my experiences as an apprentice and how I’ve learned to survive around my intelligent co-workers with only academic programming knowledge. It’s also a great chance for you to understand the mind of an apprentice and how you can apply that in the future to not scare off colleagues that don’t have very much knowledge.</p>

</summary><blockquote>
<p>Many researchers now choose to make their datasets openly available and may also release corresponding software tools to implement their techniques. However, enabling others to easily visualise and understand the data is often challenging.</p>
<p>We demonstrate a web-based results visualiser where a user can drag-and-drop raw data files (either experimental data, or the output from a software tool) into an online webpage, which proceeds to analyse the data and automatically generate interactive graphs and tables.</p>
<p>With this approach, anyone can visualise the data from any web-enabled device with a modern web browser; it supports every operating system, and does not require software to be installed.</p>
<p>We discuss the tools and techniques used to create such interactive visualisations, how they aid in the understanding of data, and the further potential. While our demonstration is custom-built for a specific purpose, we propose a framework to enable anyone to create a visualiser for their data.</p>

<p>Software is increasingly referenced in publications [1] because it has been used to produce the results being described, and because journals and funders are requiring code to be shared to improve reproducibility, encourage reuse and reduce duplication. This software may have been written to enable the work described in the publication, may be being cited to credit the original authors, or the main function of the publication could be to describe the software.</p>
<p>However it is hard both to identify software which is referenced in publications, and to assess its reusability. To address this we mined [2] the full text of papers available from EuropePMC to identify links to software repositories (here, “Github.com”). We investigated link persistence and queried the software repository to extract attributes including license information, documentation and update frequency, from which we inferred the likely reusability and sustainability of the software.</p>
<p>Our results show that there are clear differences in the reusability of software referenced in the research literature.</p>

</summary><blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, writing fast parallel code meant one of two things – using CPU threads for running multiple tasks in parallel, or getting your hands dirty to write some intrinsics or assembly to address specific bottlenecks.<br>
New classes of hardware such as GPUs, wide SIMD, FPGAs and custom AI processors/DSPs are becoming available. Programming each of these platforms requires specialised skills. We will briefly discuss choices for space constrained, compute constrained or power constrained applications.<br>
Software tool kits fall into two broad classes. The first provide a level of abstraction to reduce the complexity of multi-platform programming but this comes at a cost. Others are focused on a single platform but are able to offer better performance. This vast array of choices makes choosing the right tool for a problem tricky.<br>
We will look at example CPU/SIMD and GPU implementations of routines typically found in computer vision and AI applications. We will compare the best performance achievable from each method, while maintaining focus on the trade-offs between the effort of programming and the resulting performance.</p>

<p>What happens when a leading research computer program becomes unmaintainable? A cutting-edge research tool, yet living on borrowed time… do you keep the project limping on, or let it die? What is the legacy of “legacy code”? At the end of the 1990s, CASTEP was just such a code; a heady mix of leading-edge physics and materials science powered by an unsustainable spaghetti of FORTRAN, C and compiler extensions.</p>
<p>In this talk I will present tried and trusted philosophies and practical principles for software design and implementation. I will cover each stage of the process, from the initial design to the released software, and illustrate the principles with tales from a range of projects including CASTEP, which was completely and successfully redesigned and re-engineered in just 2 years, and continues to flourish 17 years later.</p>

</div>
<div style="clear: both;float: none"></div>
</summary><blockquote>
<p>There are 210,000 researchers in the UK and a significant number (at least a third) rely on software to conduct their research. How do we support this huge community with only a few thousand RSEs in the UK? One option is to invest effort into creating local communities that complement the work of RSEs by dealing with the straightforward questions asked by researchers.</p>
<p>Researchers require help with their software, but it is not always the in-depth software engineering that we have come to expect from RSEs. RSE Group leaders are inundated by requests for software engineering, but also by requests for simple help: which tool to use, what practices to follow, and general pointers on improving code. There are also requests for help with general, philosophical problems that do not fit well with the paid-for service model of many RSE Groups.</p>
<p>One solution, trialled by my group at the University of Southampton and others, is to create a Research Software Community comprising RSEs and “researcher-developers”. By bringing these people together, they support each other. In this talk we will discuss our successes and describe how a network of these communities could be created across academia to support researchers and RSEs.</p>

<p>Getting credit for your research software is like playing a pinball machine: Just insert a coin (file) to get the ball rolling. Then, several parts of the machine can increase your credit (via citation) and help you make the highscore: The plunger (source code repository) provides the required metadata; The flippers (metadata tooling) transfer the metadata into other formats; the bumpers (repositories/indexers) distribute and display the metadata; the bonus holes (publishers) use the metadata to publish references. The Citation File Format is that initial coin: A human- and machine-readable format for software citation metadata. No need to slam tilt: Add a CITATION.cff file to your source code, and users will have all the necessary metadata to cite your software. Required fields make sure the file is self-explanatory, and includes the metadata required for credit and re-use as per the Software Citation Principles. A file in the Citation File Format can also be read to display citation information in the repository GUI, in the referenced software itself, or in the data the latter produces. And downstream it can be converted into the CodeMeta exchange format so that all actors in the software citation workflow can read the metadata.</p>

<p>The continued foundation of new institutional RSE teams is great, but what if you still don’t have one? Who will ensure your new research software will be sustainable/re-usable after your project money is gone? You! Make your software extensible and use a generic data model. Let infrastructure handle the rest: Most components are available for free, and sustainable enough. Make use of a source code repository platform that can handle code, documentation, and communication between users, contributors and maintainers; pick one that is harvested by Software Heritage. Use a dependency repository to safeguard reproducible builds; make sure it’s the big, default one, and that it’s run from long-lasting funds. Use Zenodo for releases: It is designed to be there for the long run, and gives you a DOI. Student asistants are cheap: Document all the things, so that a capable one will be able to take over maintainership when your funding is gone. Document all the things: For users and developers; all design decisions; all infrastructure and architecture; all workflows; all community documents and processes. Our dedicated research project will do just this, learn about requirements and best practices, and share for RSEs and researcher training.</p>

<p>The Met Office continues to strive to increase the resolution of simulations and observations of the atmosphere and ocean. Consequently, the challenge of presenting the data to both operational and research users also continues to grow. Lack of suitable tools leaves big datasets under-utilised and scientists spending a lot of time on technical issues or waiting for results rather than doing analysis.<br>
This talk will discuss these challenges for a specific application for SE Asia and consider the tool’s use in other contexts. The key goal of the tool is to provide interactive access to visualisations high-resolution data from multiple sources through a single web portal that is accessible both in the Met Office and in SE Asia.<br>
I will discuss how we are using cloud infrastructure running widely available python tools to create a tool that provides a common visualisation platform for research and operational users, facilitating better collaboration. We have been working with the Informatics Lab and using the Pangeo platform to visualise big datasets and develop code that researchers can extend. We aim to enable users to utilise the wealth of available data to provide better forecast products and do better research</p>

<p>Research software is mainly developed by scientists who are domain experts. Most of them have no specific education in software development. To support research scientists at the German Aerospace Center, we created a set of software engineering guidelines for different fields of software development.<br>
At RSE17, we already presented the concept of the guidelines. This time, we want to share the practical experiences we collected over the last year.</p>
<p>In this talk, we want to practically introduce the guidelines and the<br>
classification scheme. Particularly, we demonstrate their usage in context of<br>
two real-world research software applications. The first example demonstrates<br>
the usage of the guidelines when starting a new software development. In this<br>
case the focus is on finding the initial steps and getting an overview of future<br>
aspects. The second example is about an existing, legacy software application.<br>
In this case the focus is on analysing what is already there and finding out the<br>
next suitable steps. In this context, the accompanying checklists function as an<br>
ongoing planning document and the classification scheme helps to find the<br>
suitable starting point.</p>

<p>A range of novel surgical tools are under development at the Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences. To facilitate the integration of these new tools, such as concentric tube robots, with existing imaging (Slicer, NIFTK, OpenIGTLink) and control software, a common development platform and workflow is required, to reduce overheads involved with testing and deploying new devices.</p>
<p>A key challenge in this area of work is ensuring that software and hardware developments are not carried out in isolation. By providing a standardised set of software libraries, working environments and documentation, new hardware developments can be designed to be compatible with existing infrastructure from the outset.</p>
<p>This work heavily utilises the open source Robot Operating System (ROS), which consists of a set of C++/Python libraries for control of, and communication between, robotic devices, based around a simple message passing system.</p>

</summary><blockquote>
<p>Much of modern science relies upon computing. Despite this fact, fewer than 12% of code papers surveyed in Science recently were found to have code and data readily accessible [1]. This is a problem for many reasons. Science has, historically, always been peer reviewed before being considered valid. If the code isn’t available online, what is the likelihood it has been peer reviewed? When the code backing the science is wrong, the science is wrong too. Furthermore, if a paper talks about computational results, there is no way to reproduce the paper without having the code available. It seems unlikely that a paper describing a mathematical proof could omit the proof itself, so why is this tolerated for computer code?</p>
<p>The Code is Science manifesto [2] is a call to funders, journals, researchers, and research institutions to recognise code as a fundamental part of science, making it open source, peer reviewed, and code credited as a scientific output equivalent to papers or data. The manifesto is currently in a public consultation period and will launch formally in early June.</p>

<p>UiOHive is an initiative from the Department of Geosciences (University of Oslo, Norway) to establish a local knowledge hub around the development of new observation devices and connect individuals with different backgrounds and titles (technicians, lab engineer, research software engineers, students, PhDs, postdocs, researchers, etc.) but all interested in utilizing IoT technologies, applying AI/ML to solve data challenges, and sharing knowledge across relevant interdisciplinary domains.<br>
The need arose within the “Land-Atmosphere Interactions in Cold Environments” project where the development of observation sensors triggered new challenges related to IoT technologies. To overcome these obstacles, a revolutionary approach is required with strong software and hardware co-design strategy at its center.<br>
To establish a community and form a foundation of knowledge, UiOHive will provide the infrastructure to 1) educate (workshops, hackathons) students and scientists about the potential of IoT technology for building new observation tools, 2) share existing facilities (electronic labs, in-situ Research Station), 3) create collaborative platform to share solutions, problems, and simply exchange across departments at the university.</p>
