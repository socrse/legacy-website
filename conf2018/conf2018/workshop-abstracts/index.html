The solution is typically parallelisation.</p>
<p>In this workshop you will be introduced to parallelisation constructs available in MATLAB. You will learn basics like parallelising a for-loop, to more advanced practices like asynchronous execution, communicating between process for reporting intermediate results and optimising data transfer overheads. You will also discover how easy it is to scale by leveraging clusters, whether local or cloud based.</p>

Increasing model training data size generally improves model prediction and performance, but deploying models at scale is a challenge.</p>
<p>Participants in this workshop will learn to use Amazon SageMaker, an AWS service that simplifies the machine learning process and enables training on cloud stored datasets at any scale. With Amazon SageMaker, users take their code and analysis to the data using familiar data science tools (Jupyter notebooks), learning frameworks (MXNet and TensorFlow), and easy to use SDKs for Python and Spark.</p>
<p>Attendees will walk through the process of building a model, training it, and applying it for prediction against large open scientific datasets such as satellite imagery and 1000 Genomes data. By the end of the session, attendees will have the resources and experience to start using Amazon SageMaker and related AWS services to accelerate their scientific research and time to discovery.</p>

<p>Initially, the audience will learn the most basic steps to install and run an Intel optimized Python distribution. Then the audience will be guided to apply techniques on how to get the best performance out of Python. The audience will use Intel libraries (e.g. pyDaal) and examples from classical machine learning field in order to gain deeper insights in performance optimization.</p>

Given that the only bug free code is no code, as soon as you start committing you are committing to one path over another.</p>
<p>How might tools from lean product development help in prioritising feature development? How might they help with thinking about sustainability models for software projects?</p>
<p>Lean product development is a practice that evolved from the Toyota production system and it aims to eliminate waste in systems by:</p>
<ul><li>Efficiently managing inventory (backlog of feature requests)</li>
<li>Understanding process flow (lead time and cycle times)</li>
<li>Managing risk through reducing cycle times for experimentation.</li>
</ul><p>In this workshop we will look at a hierarchy of tools that can help with thinking about prioritisation questions, from project level down to specific feature level.</p>

<details id="an-introduction-to-julia"><summary><strong>An introduction to Julia</strong><br><em>Valentin Churavy, JuliaLab@CSAIL, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</em></summary><blockquote><p>Julia is a programming language that was designed to avoid the “N+1<br>
language” problem currently plaguing the scientific community, where high-level scripting languages are preferred by domain experts for productivity, but low-level languages are required for high performance and access to hardware-specific features.</p>
<p>In this workshop I will introduce participants to Julia, with the goal to explore how Julia manages to be both a high-level, easy to program language while not leaving performance on the table. This allows for productive collaboration using a single source language.</p>
<p>Participants will also be learning how to call other languages from Julia and how they can call Julia projects from their existing codebase.</p>
<p>Time permitting I will briefly explore topics on how to do benchmarking, performance measurements, distributed computing, and GPU programming in Julia.</p>

<details id="using-singularity-for-high-performance-computing"><summary><strong>Using Singularity for High Performance Computing</strong><br><em>Mihai Duta, Diamond Light Source<br>
Andrew Gittings, University of Oxford</em></summary><blockquote><p>The use of containers is one of the hot topics at the moment in high throughput and high performance computing. Container technology, initially designed for micro-service virtualisation, has found an expanding role in scientific computing for at least two reasons:</p>
<ol><li>containers allow a relatively easy management of software processing pipelines (often complex and with restrictive software dependencies) in a way that is independent from the computing platforms on which they run and</li>
<li>a consequence of the above, containers facilitate the reproducibility of computing results.</li>
</ol><p>Designed with a focus on high performance computing, Singularity is arguably the container of choice for the data centre in a scientific facility. In a one-off effort, Singularity can package a “difficult” application with complex dependencies and a “temperamental” installation, creating a portable, shareable, and re-usable job environment. With this, Singularity offers the combined advantage of reproducible runs and easy control of the software stack at a price of only a modest decrease in performance relative to “native” runs.</p>
<p>This workshop will give participants an understanding of Singularity’s mode of operation and of what makes it particularly suitable for reproducible research. The topics covered using hands-on examples will be</p>
<ol><li>the concept of containers and an introduction to Singularity;</li>
<li>creating and boostrapping Singularity container images;</li>
<li>pulling and running pre-packaged images from Singularity Hub;</li>
<li>converting Docker images to Singularity;</li>
<li>managing data: creating, importing, exporting, mounting, etc.</li>
</ol><p>To enable participants understand the function of Singularity in scientific computing, the following two topics will also be discussed</p>
<ol><li>running MPI-distributed applications and enabling GPUs;</li>
<li>Singularity integration with cluster resource managers.</li>

Matthew Hartley, John Innes Centre</em></summary><blockquote><p>The explosion in volumes and types of data has led to substantial challenges in data management. These challenges are often faced by front-line researchers who are already dealing with rapidly changing technologies and have limited time to devote to data management.</p>
<p>There are good high level guidelines for managing and processing scientific data. However, there is a lack of simple, practical tools to implement these guidelines. This is particularly problematic in a highly distributed research environment where needs differ substantially from group to group, centralised solutions are difficult to implement and storage technologies change rapidly.</p>
<p>To meet these challenges we have developed dtool, a command line tool for managing data. The tool packages data and metadata into a unified whole, which we call a dataset. The dataset provides consistency checking and the ability to access metadata for both the whole dataset and individual files. The tool can store these datasets on several different storage systems, including traditional filesystem, object store (S3 and Azure) and iRODS. It includes an application programming interface that can be used to incorporate it into existing pipelines and workflows.</p>
<p>The tool has provided substantial process, cost, and peace-of-mind benefits to our data management practices and we want to share these benefits. The tool is open source and available freely online at http://dtool.readthedocs.io.</p>

<details id="the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-parallelism-with-python"><summary><strong>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Parallelism with Python</strong><br><em>Declan Valters, University of Edinburgh</em></summary><blockquote><p>Classical thinking on Python is that it does not support parallel programming very well, and that ‘proper’ parallel programming is best left to the ‘heavy-duty’ languages such as Fortran or C++.</p>
<p>This workshop will challenge that assumption through a hands-on tour of the options that are available for parallel programming with Python. It will start with a brief introduction to the issues that have given rise to this traditional thinking, namely the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), and why this currently prevents traditional thread-based parallelism in Python.</p>
<p>The workshop will then cover in a series of hands-on exercises some of the alternative approaches to parallelising problems using Python libraries including:</p>
<ol><li>The ‘multiprocessing’ module for simple process-based or task parallelism.</li>
<li>Auto-parallelisation of numeric codes with the ‘numba’ library</li>
<li>Message Passing Interface (MPI) approaches to parallelism with the `mpi4py` library.</li>
<li>A look at how to circumvent the GIL issue with the Cython library and OpenMP.</li>
</ol><p>Finally we will compare and contrast the various Python parallelisation approaches covered in the workshop, with a discussion on how to chose the right approach for a particular software problem, and when it might be appropriate to look beyond Python for parallelism if necessary.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the workshop will give attendees a broad knowledge-base of Python parallelisation approaches which they can take home and apply to their own research and scientific Python codes. Attendees will be encouraged to share their own insights in the discussion session at the end.</p>
